For simulating IoT device I am using AWS IoT Sdk for Python. To use the following files please download the python sdk.
1. Simulated_code.zip
	- contains the code used for simulating sensor module
	- place the hydratrack folder inside aws-iot-device-sdk-python folder
	- place the start.ps1 script in the same folder where your certificate files reside


2. Pi_code.zip
	- contains the AWS client side code and sensor module code
